# What does this app do?

It's pretty simple, really. A user searches for the weather of a city. The app responds with current weather information, forecast for the next 24 hours, and then some cards a user can flip over with common questions they may ask themselves, including:

- Will I need a coat?
- Will I need to warm up the car?
- Will I need to wear shorts?
- Will I need to bring an umbrella?
  ...and so on.
